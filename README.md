# Understanding patterns of success among postsecondary CTE students: A diagnostic for institutional and system analysts
This repository contains web guides, Stata code, R code and sample
data to help education data analysts answer questions about student success in CTE pathways. 
This material can also be accessed on the
OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is based on code from the "Analyze" section of the
[Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use).

This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `R` includes resources for implementation in R
- `Stata` includes resources for implementation in Stata
- - `code` contains the code for the analysis 
- -`data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- - `docs` contains CTE Toolkit web guides and images
- - - Do files with a `_webdoc` suffix generate both charts and web guides using the Stata webdoc package
- - - Do files without the `_webdoc` suffix are automatically generated versions of the do files stripped of webdoc commands and markdown content
- - - Run `run_webdoc.do` to run through the individual do files, generate the guides, and generate stripped versions of the chart code.

These materials were originally authored by Chris Avery, Jon Fullerton, Brian Johnson, Adrienne Murphy, Alyssa Reinhart, and Elise Swanson.

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic
code, tools, and training intended to foster collaboration among education
analysts and researchers in order to accelerate the improvement of our school
systems. The community is hosted by the
[Strategic Data Project](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu), an initiative of the
[Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University](https://cepr.harvard.edu).
We welcome contributions and feedback.
