# Understanding patterns of success among postsecondary CTE students: A diagnostic for institutional and system analysts
This repository contains web guides, Stata code, and sample
data to help education data analysts answer questions about student success in CTE pathways. 
This material can also be accessed on the
OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is based on code from the "Analyze" section of the
[Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use).

This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `code` contains the Stata code of the analysis 
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `docs` contains CTE Toolkit web guides and images

These materials were originally authored by Chris Avery, Jon Fullerton, Brian Johnson, Adrienne Murphy, Alyssa Reinhart, and Elise Swanson.

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic
